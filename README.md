# SimpleMaths

This is a simple app, which let's you input variables to calculate the pythagoras or zeros for an x²-function.

There are 3 input fields, which let you input any decimal number.

Calculating the pythagoras:
Depending on which textfield is empty, the missing variable gets calculated by clicking on "Pythagoras".

Calculating the zeros:
Your input should have this formular: ax² + bx + c

By inserting these variables and clicking the "Zeros"-Button, you get 2 decimal numbers, at which the graph you input is = 0.

Ignore the folder names, i used kind of a preset from another project.
